HOWTO
------------------

1. in config/start_dumbbell.pl: insert the right kernel to boot for the leaf nodes

2. rename config/delay-1.sh to your node K9 (e.g. delay-1.sh -> vmrouter209 for an offset of 200)
   rename config/delay-2.sh to your node K15

3. create measurement-scripts and place them in the config-folder
   make sure that these scripts know the parameters -o for offset and -L for the output folder

4. edit the analyze section in start.sh
